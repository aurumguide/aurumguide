We will explain the DELETE DML statement used to delete data in a TABLE.

## <mark>DELETE DML basic structure</mark>

### ***Using the FROM clause.***

- syntax code  
DELETE  
FROM [TABLE name]  
WHERE [conditional statement];

### ***How to delete after omitting the FROM clause.***

- syntax code  
DELETE [TABLE name]  
WHERE [conditional statement];

## <mark>Example of DELETE DML statement usage</mark>

### ***How to clear TABLE with basic structure.***

- `Question:` Please DELETE all contents of the UserInfoForDelete table.

```sql  
USE sampleDB;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS UserInfoForDelete;
CREATE TABLE UserInfoForDelete (
    UserId int NOT NULL,
    UserNm varchar(255),
    UserAge  int
);

insert into  UserInfoForDelete(UserId,UserNm,UserAge) 
values
('202401','kim',60),
('202402','lee',84),
('202403','park',90),
('202404','moon',65),
('202405','young',35),
('202406','cho',45)


USE sampleDB;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS BoardJoinDelete;
CREATE TABLE BoardJoinDelete (
    BoardNo int NOT NULL,
    BoardTitle varchar(255),
    UserId  int
);
 
insert into  BoardJoinDelete(BoardNo,BoardTitle,UserId) 
values
(1,'seoul',202401),
(2,'busun',202402), 
(3,'inchen',202404)

-- 1. How to clear TABLE with basic structure.
-- Check if data exists
SELECT * FROM UserInfoForDelete;
-- Delete Data
delete FROM UserInfoForDelete;
-- Check if the deletion was successful
SELECT * FROM UserInfoForDelete;
```

### ***How to delete data by joining with another table.***

- `Question:` Join the registered ID of UserInfoForDelete and DELETE the data of BoardJoinDelete.

```sql
-- 2. How to DELETE by joining with another table.
-- Example 1
DELETE BD
  FROM BoardJoinDelete BD  
  JOIN UserInfoForDelete UD
  ON BD.UserId = UD.UserId;

-- Example 2
DELETE BoardJoinDelete
  FROM BoardJoinDelete BD  
  JOIN UserInfoForDelete UD
  ON BD.UserId = UD.UserId;
```

### ***How to delete data using subquery.***

- `Question:` Use Sub Query to DELETE the bulletin board data of the member whose UserId is '202401' in UserInfoForDelete.

```sql
-- 3. How to delete data using subquery.
-- Example 1
DELETE 
  FROM BoardJoinDelete
  WHERE UserId IN (
                   SELECT UserId
                     FROM UserInfoForDelete a
                     WHERE a.UserId ='202401'
                  );
-- Example 2
DELETE 
  FROM BoardJoinDelete 
  WHERE EXISTS ( 
                SELECT *
                FROM UserInfoForDelete a 
                WHERE a.UserId ='202401' 
                AND A.UserId = BoardJoinDelete.UserId
                );
```

### ***How to limit the number of rows deleted using TOP.***

The TOP(n) clause in a DELETE statement allows you to randomly select n rows for deletion.  

- `Question:` Delete only two items of UserInfoForDelete using Top.  

```SQL
-- 4. How to limit the number of rows deleted using TOP.
DELETE TOP(2)
  FROM UserInfoForDelete
  WHERE UserId LIKE '2024%'
```

### ***Check deleted data using OUTPUT in the DELETE statement.***

- `Question:` Enter the deleted data into the table variable and check the deleted data.

```SQL
-- 5. Check deleted data using OUTPUT in the DELETE statement. 
-- table variable declaration
DECLARE @UserInfoForDeleteVar table (  
  UserId int NOT NULL,
  UserNm varchar(255),
  UserAge  int
);  
 
-- Putting it in a table variable while deleting it.
DELETE UserInfoForDelete
OUTPUT DELETED.UserId,  
    DELETED.UserNm,
    DELETED.UserAge  
  INTO @UserInfoForDeleteVar
FROM UserInfoForDelete     
;  
  
--Confirm deletion data
SELECT * 
FROM @UserInfoForDeleteVar 
;
```

## <mark>DELETE DML statement precautions</mark>

### ***Unconditional DELETE DML statement.***

Executing an unconditional DELETE DML statement deletes all records in that table.  
It is a good idea to check deleted DATA using table variables and OUTPUT.  

### ***Use transactions in DELETE DML.***

Since the DELETE DML statement means permanent deletion of data, DBAs use rollbacks using transactions to prevent mistakes.

### ***Use WHERE in DELETE DML.***

When executing a DELETE DML statement, it is important to clearly specify the WHERE condition to limit the target DATA to be deleted.
