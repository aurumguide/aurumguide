LOGON Trigger is an event that occurs when a user session is established in a SQL Server instance, and is used to control user logins.

## <mark>LOGIN Trigger Characteristics</mark>

- LOGON Trigger can be thought of as another type of stored procedure that responds to the LOGON event.
- LOGON Trigger occurs after the authentication phase of login is completed, but before the user session is established.

- In other words, the trigger is executed when a session is created after authentication of the user ID, password, and authority is completed.
- LOGON Trigger is not executed if authentication of the user ID, password, or authority fails. - LOGON Trigger is used when tracking the activities of logged-in users.
- You can also restrict logins to SQL Server, and limit or control the number of sessions for a specific login.

- See the explanation of the picture in the post about Trigger features and types.

GO

CREATE TRIGGER tr_AurumGuide_Login_Trigger ON ALL SERVER
WITH EXECUTE AS N'AurumGuideLoginTrigger'
FOR LOGON AS BEGIN
    IF ORIGINAL_LOGIN() = N'AurumGuideLoginTrigger'
    AND (
        SELECT COUNT(*)
        FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions
        WHERE is_user_process = 1

    AurumId           varchar(100),
    loginTime         datetime 
); 
GO 
-- CREATE TRIGGER;
CREATE TRIGGER tr_AurumGuide_Login_Log ON ALL SERVER
WITH EXECUTE AS N'AurumGuideLoginTrigger'
FOR LOGON AS BEGIN
  IF ORIGINAL_LOGIN() = N'AurumGuideLoginTrigger'
  BEGIN 
    insert into AurumGuide_Login_Trigger
    values('AurumGuideLoginTrigger',GETDATE())
     ;
    END;
END;
go
SELECT *
 FROM AurumGuide_Login_Trigger;
```

## <mark>LOGIN Trigger Notes</mark>

- When creating a LOGIN Trigger, I want to perform specific tasks for specific LOGIN IDs.
- For example, if the access history for all LOGIN IDs is recorded in a table and the table is accidentally deleted,
- A LOGIN Trigger error occurs and no one can access the server.
- You need to delete the trigger to be able to access SQL Server.
- If it is not possible to resolve, please let me know in the reply.
