## <mark>MSSQL Trigger Advantages.</mark>

- Triggers provide functions that procedures do not provide, and procedures can also be used within Triggers.
- Triggers are used when you need to check the validity of data inserted or updated in bulk in a program.
- Triggers can be used to implement referential integrity throughout the database.
- Triggers can be used to implement data referential integrity and enforce business rules. - Triggers are useful when you want to find incorrect data based on specific conditions when data is entered, updated, or deleted.

## <mark>Disadvantages of MSSQL Triggers.</mark>

- The biggest disadvantage of Triggers is that they can cause performance degradation of the database server. - Since Triggers are part of a transaction, they may remain locked while the work is in progress, which may cause server failure.
- If there are many nested Triggers, debugging and troubleshooting become very difficult, making maintenance impossible.
- It is recommended not to use Triggers on undocumented servers.
